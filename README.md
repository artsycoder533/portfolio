## Overview

I am a Self-Taught Front-End Developer/Freelancer who genuinely enjoys creating responsive and interactive websites and applications. I am always seeking to learn new skills and increase my knowledge base. I created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGjYAACGwNLzYcTpXnvZ_Q) to track my progress, as well as share demo videos of projects I am currently working on.

I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Psychology from Old Dominion University along with 11 years of experience in Corrections, primarily as a Counselor. I have always had a passion for helping others and I now desire to use technology to provide solutions.
