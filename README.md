## Overview

I am a Self-Taught Front-End Developer/Freelancer who enjoys creating responsive and interactive websites and applications. I am always seeking to learn new skills and increase my knowlege base. Even though my famililarity is with the Front End I am open and interested in learning the back end as well.

I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Psychology from Old Dominion University along with 11 years of experience in Corrections. I have always had a passion for helping others and I now desire to use technology to provide solutions.
